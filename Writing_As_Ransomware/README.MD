OneWayLinuxRansomware.py is specifically for Linux distros and you will need to Replace the filepath= "/home/parrot/Esu/low.key" within the code with your actual directory where the ransomware program is being run.

  This allows you to run and encrypt files within a directory forever. Navigate to the specific target directory of your choice and run the code.

      Go into the Target Directory using [ cd Target_Directory ]

      Type [ sudo python3 OneWayLinuxRansomware.py ] and every file within the directory would be encrypted
